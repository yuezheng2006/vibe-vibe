## What is Vibe Coding?

> "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."
>
> — Andrej Karpathy, 2025

**Vibe Coding** is one of the most influential AI-native ways of building in 2025 (and a Collins Dictionary Word of the Year). On Vibe Vibe, we treat it as an important path inside a broader idea: **AI creation**.

- **Describe goals and requirements in natural language**, instead of manually doing every step yourself
- **Let AI help with implementation, structure, and iteration**, while you review and steer
- **Move quickly from idea to working artifact**, because something real teaches you faster than a perfect plan

Simply put: **you provide direction, judgment, and taste; AI helps you make the work real.**

## This Course Is Bigger Than Just "Learning AI Programming"

This course is not designed to turn you into a senior engineer overnight.

You will not suddenly master algorithms, framework internals, or interview-style computer science.

But you will gain:

- The ability to turn ideas into real projects
- A repeatable way to collaborate with AI
- Better product judgment, iteration habits, and shipping confidence

That is a different goal, but it is an extremely practical one.

## Who Should Learn This?

| Who You Are | Recommended Path | Reason |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Designer / Product Manager | Fundamentals | Build working prototypes with zero coding background |
| Liberal Arts / Career Switcher | Fundamentals | Start from the most basic concepts, progress step by step |
| Frontend Developer | Advanced | Expand backend capabilities, become a full-stack engineer |
| Backend Developer | Advanced | Understand modern frontend ecosystem and Next.js |
| Entrepreneur / Indie Developer | Both | Quickly build MVPs, complete products independently |
| Developers Seeking Efficiency | Fundamentals + Advanced | Systematically learn AI-assisted development workflow |
